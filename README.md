# YoloV3_video_colab
This Jupyter notebook explains how to run YOLO on Google Colab, for videos. 
It solves two problems
- Installing CUDA on Google Colab. (Looks like Colab does not have CUDA installed!)
- Using a forked version of YOLO - https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/ which provides a way in which 
we can run object detection on videos without display, using -dont_show option.

For more info on how to install CUDNN/CuPy, look at this notebook
